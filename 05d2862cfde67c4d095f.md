title: findコマンドで検索したファイルを削除する方法の速度を比較してみた
tags: Linux ShellScript Bash
author: sayuprc
slide: false
---
## 結論

`-exec rm -f {} +` `-delete` `xargs rm -f` はほぼ同じ速度なので状況に応じて使い分けるとよさそう。

`-exec rm -f {} \;` は他3つと比べて大きく劣るので特別な理由がない限り使わないほうがいい。

※deleteオプションは環境によっては使えない場合があるらしい。[^1]

※xargsはファイルにスペースなど特殊な文字列が含まれていると削除できないため、別途対応が必要。[^2]

## 検証環境

マシン: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B(メモリ4GB)

OS: Debian 11

## 検証するコマンド

1. `find -exec rm -f {} \;`
2. `find -exec rm -f {} +`
3. `find -delete`
4. `find | xargs rm -f`

## 検証方法

削除対象ディレクトリに2万ファイル(うち削除対象1万ファイル)を用意し、findコマンドで検索、削除を行う。

処理時間の計測はtimeコマンドを用いる。

一つのコマンドに対し100回計測を行い、平均値で比較する。

### 検証用プログラム

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# 削除対象ディレクトリ
REMOVE_TARGET_DIR="./target"

# 空ファイル作成
touchFile(){
  touch $REMOVE_TARGET_DIR/{1..10000}
  touch $REMOVE_TARGET_DIR/{1..10000}.log
}

# 100回やる
for i in {1..100};
do
  # 検証1
  # -exec rm -f {} \;
  touchFile
  (time find $REMOVE_TARGET_DIR -name "*.log" -type f -exec rm -f {} \;) > "exec_slow_$i.log" 2>&1

  # 検証2
  # -exec rm -f {} +
  touchFile
  (time find $REMOVE_TARGET_DIR -name "*.log" -type f -exec rm -f {} +) > "exec_fast_$i.log" 2>&1


  # 検証3
  # -delete
  touchFile
  (time find $REMOVE_TARGET_DIR -name "*.log" -type f -delete) > "option_$i.log" 2>&1

  # 検証4
  # xargs rm -f
  touchFile
  (time find $REMOVE_TARGET_DIR -name "*.log" -type f | xargs rm -f) > "xargs_$i.log" 2>&1
done
```

## まとめ

ただファイルを消すだけなら`-delete`を使う。

`-delete`が使えない環境なら`-exec rm -f {} +`を利用するのがよさそう。(使えない環境が存在するのかは不明)

ファイルに特殊な文字列が入らないことが確定しているなら`xargs rm -f`も選択肢としてあり。
